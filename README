1. What it is?

   sinod stands for Simple Notification Daemon.
   
   It is very simple implementation of notification daemon concept. This program
   registers DBUS org.freedesktop.Notifications service and prints all incoming
   notifications on standard output. 

2. What can I use it for?

   unlike other notification daemons sinod does not displays any pop-up
   windows. It only prints notifications on standard output. Its output can be
   easily used by other scripts or programs. It can also be used in
   environment without X windows at all (hey, think about notifications from
   your screened irc session on shell acount a few thousands kilometers away!)

3. Who wrote it?

   sinod is based on statnot program written by Henrik Hallberg.
   See http://www.k2h.se/code/statnot.html for more details.

   Current version is maintained by Pawe≈Ç Zuzelski <pawelz@pld-linux.org>

4. But can I use it? So great software... It must be quite expensive!

   It should be. But it is not. It is licensed under the terms of GNU GPL
   version 3 or any later. That means you can use it, modify, redistribute,
   even sell.

5. It is not exactly what I need.

   So try other implementations of notification daemon:

   * statnot:
     http://www.k2h.se/code/statnot.html

   * notification-daemon:
     http://www.galago-project.org/

   * notification-daemon-xfce:
     http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/notification-daemon-xfce

   * knotify4
     Part of KDE Desktop Environment 4

Enjoy!
